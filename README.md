Python-Based Species Classification Wireless Camera
📖 Overview
This project is a smart wireless camera system designed for forest monitoring and wildlife research. It uses Python and machine learning to automatically identify animal species from camera footage.

⚙️ Features
Captures live video from a camera module
Splits video into frames for analysis
Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to classify animal species
Stores detected species with name, ID, date, and time
Saves unknown or new species images for further study
Can be used for forest survey and wildlife monitoring

🧠 Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
Raspberry Pi
Wireless camera module

🚀 How It Works
The camera captures live video in the forest.
Video is divided into frames for processing.
The system analyzes each frame using a trained model.
Detected animals are logged with details and saved to the database.
Unknown species images are stored for manual review.

🌱 Applications
Wildlife monitoring
Forest surveys
Research on animal behavior and biodiversity
