# 🐾 Python-Based Species Classification Wireless Camera

## 📘 Overview
This project is a smart wireless camera system that helps monitor forests and wildlife. It uses Python and machine learning to detect and identify animal species from live camera footage.

## ⚙️ Features
- Captures live video using a wireless camera
- Splits video into frames for analysis
- Detects and classifies animal species using a trained model
- Saves details like species name, ID, date, and time
- Stores unknown species images for future research
- Useful for forest survey and animal monitoring

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- Raspberry Pi  
- Wireless Camera Module

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The camera captures live footage in the forest.
2. The video is divided into frames.
3. Each frame is analyzed using a pre-trained model.
4. Identified species are saved with details in the database.
5. Unknown images are stored for further review.

## 🌿 Applications
- Wildlife monitoring  
- Forest surveys  
- Animal behavior study  
- Biodiversity research
