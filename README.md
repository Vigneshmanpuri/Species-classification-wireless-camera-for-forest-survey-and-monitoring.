# Species-classification-wireless-camera-for-forest-survey-and-monitoring.
This project builds a smart wireless camera system for forest monitoring using a TensorFlow-based model and Raspberry Pi. It captures video, splits it into frames, runs species detection via pre-trained models, logs identified species (with name, ID, date/time) and saves unknown frames for later study.
